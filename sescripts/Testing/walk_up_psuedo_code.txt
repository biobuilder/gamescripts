Scratch all that.  Just use a timer-based jump up mechanism.

Operator instructions
1. Fill tanks with sufficient materials
2. Set projection
3. Unlock from base and turn on welders
4. Set spinning rotor to about 1 - 2 RPM
5. Begin build sequence

Timer sequence
Weld delay: 60 seconds
 - Actions: increase thrust override (upward thruster blocks)
 - Start thrust override delay timer
Thrust override delay: 3-4 seconds
 - Actions: remove thrust override (upward thruster blocks)
 - Start weld timer block

A sensor stops the weld head by disabling the Weld delay timer once the weld head reaches the end of the track


Sensors list:
1 sensor for the connector
1 sensor for the top of the rail

1 piston capable of extending up to 1 block per stroke

If player enacts Restart/Connect sequence, the machine will:
Turn off welders
Check connector sensor for presence of connector block
Take 1 step downward (Piston always starts and ends as retracted)
 - Unlock bottom gear
 - Lock top gear
 - Extend piston
 - Unlock top gear
 - Lock bottom gear
 - Retract piston
Repeat until the sensor detects the connector block
Release all landing gear
Connect the connector block


If player enacts Build sequence, the machine will:
Release the connector block
Check top sensor for End Detection
